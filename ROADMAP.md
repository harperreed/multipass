## Major Progress Update (Latest) 🚀

**UI Modernization Complete!** We've successfully transformed MultiPass from a retro-styled interface into a professional, enterprise-ready application:

- **Three-Page Architecture**: Clean separation with login → file browser → editor flow
- **Modern Design**: Tailwind CSS throughout with consistent styling and UX patterns
- **Enhanced Editor**: Auto-save, keyboard shortcuts, change detection, and proper state management
- **Professional File Browser**: File icons, metadata display, version counts, and clean navigation
- **Improved Authentication**: Streamlined passkey creation and access flows

**Next Priority**: Tag hierarchy and advanced search functionality to complete the file browser experience.

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### 1. File Browser UI with Tag-Based Navigation 🎨
**Priority: High** → **Partially Complete** ✅

~~Transform the current simple vault interface into a sophisticated file browser:~~

- ✅ **File Grid/List View**: Modern file browser with icons, metadata, version counts
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Professional Interface**: Clean three-page architecture (login → files → editor)
- 🔄 **Tag Hierarchy Display**: Convert tags like `docs/home/recipes` into nested folder view
- 🔄 **Tag Management**: Create, rename, delete tags with drag-and-drop organization
- 🔄 **Search & Filter**: Real-time search across filenames and tags (basic search implemented)

**Technical Notes:**
- ✅ Replaced `static/index.html` with clean template-based design
- ✅ Using existing `FileBrowserResponse` and `FileInfo` types
- 🔄 Still need: client-side tag parsing for hierarchical display

### 2. CodeMirror 6 + Y.js Text Editor Integration 📝
**Priority: High** → **Partially Complete** ✅

~~Replace simple text areas with a powerful, collaborative-ready editor:~~

- ✅ **Auto-save**: Real-time local persistence with conflict-free editing
- ✅ **Full-Screen Interface**: Clean editor with proper navigation and controls
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+S save, Escape navigation, unsaved change warnings
- 🔄 **CodeMirror 6 Setup**: Syntax highlighting, themes, extensions (still using textarea)
- 🔄 **Y.js Integration**: Operational transform for local editing state
- 🔄 **Multiple File Types**: Markdown, code, plain text with appropriate highlighting
- 🔄 **Optional Preview**: Side-by-side markdown preview toggle

**Technical Notes:**
- ✅ Editor component with proper state management implemented
- ✅ Auto-save functionality with 3-second delay
- 🔄 Still need: CodeMirror 6 and Y.js integration for advanced features

### 3. Hybrid Versioning System ⏱️
**Priority: High** → **Partially Complete** ✅

~~Implement intelligent version creation with multiple triggers:~~

- ✅ **Manual Save**: User-triggered version creation with change summaries
- ✅ **Auto-save**: Time-based saving (3 seconds after changes)
- ✅ **Change Detection**: Basic content change tracking and unsaved state
- ✅ **Version Metadata**: Timestamps and change summaries stored
- 🔄 **Delta-Based Versioning**: Auto-save when 20-25% of content changes
- 🔄 **Version Browsing**: Timeline view, diff visualization, restore functionality

**Technical Notes:**
- ✅ Using existing `SaveVersionRequest` with change summaries
- ✅ Auto-save and manual save with proper state management
- 🔄 Still need: intelligent delta detection and version browsing UI

### 4. Zero-Knowledge Encryption Enhancement 🔐
**Priority: High**

Upgrade encryption to true zero-knowledge using WebAuthn private keys:

- **WebAuthn Key Derivation**: Use passkey private key for encryption instead of passwords
- **Version-Level Encryption**: Each file version encrypted individually
- **Metadata Protection**: Encrypt filenames, tags, change summaries
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation from WebAuthn credentials
- **Backward Compatibility**: Migration path from current encryption

**Technical Notes:**
- Research WebAuthn private key extraction for encryption
- Update `crypto.rs` to use passkey-derived keys
- Modify entities to support encrypted metadata
- Implement key rotation and recovery mechanisms

### 5. Advanced File Operations 📁
**Priority: Medium**

Complete the file management experience:

- **File Operations**: Create, rename, delete, duplicate files
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select, batch delete, tag management
- **Import/Export**: Upload files, export decrypted content
- **File Templates**: Quick-create templates for common file types
- **Trash/Recovery**: Soft delete with recovery option

**Technical Notes:**
- Implement remaining storage methods in SeaORM layer
- Add file operation API endpoints
- Create confirmation dialogs and progress indicators
- Design undo/redo system for file operations

### 6. Performance & Polish 🚀
**Priority: Medium**

Production-ready improvements:

- **Lazy Loading**: Paginated file lists, on-demand version loading
- **Caching**: Client-side caching of decrypted content and metadata
- **Progressive Loading**: Skeleton screens, optimistic updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and recovery
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**Technical Notes:**
- Implement pagination in SeaORM queries
- Add IndexedDB for client-side caching
- Create comprehensive error boundary components
- Add ARIA labels and keyboard shortcuts

## Technical Architecture Decisions Made

1. **SeaORM**: Chosen for robust schema management and relationships
2. **Tag-Based Organization**: Flexible hierarchy without complex folder structures
3. **Individual Version Encryption**: Better performance and security than batch encryption
4. **Hybrid Versioning**: Balances automatic safety with user control
5. **CodeMirror 6**: Modern editor with excellent extensibility

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- **Multi-vault Support**: Multiple isolated vaults per user
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Secure sharing with other passkey users
- **Sync & Backup**: End-to-end encrypted cloud synchronization
- **Plugins**: Custom extensions for specific file types
- **Analytics**: Usage insights and file organization suggestions
